## Introduction

This tool can be used for collecting information useful for estimating the scope and impact of open source software.

The following data is collected for the analysis.

- Commit data for repositories
  - Commit ID (hash)
  - Timestamp (datetime)
  - Repository (slug)
  - Author (login)
  - Lines added (Integer)
  - Lines deleted (Integer)
  - As of (datetime of when information was queried)
- Repository data
  - Slug (owner/name)
  - Creation Date
  - License (SPDX)

Additional data such as user information can be obtained from the [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/) project.

## Licenses

The official list of Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved licenses is hosted at their [website](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).

On the OSI licenses database:

- 12 are superseded
- 5 are retired
- 78 are active OSI approved

GitHub uses the Ruby Gem [Licensee](https://licensee.github.io/licensee/) for systematically detecting the license of repositories (GitHub [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#detecting-a-license)). It detects among 38 different [licenses](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/tree/gh-pages/_licenses) out of which 29 are OSI-approved licenses (28 active licenses and 1 superseded). These licenses include the most commonly used ones.

The following licenses are both GitHub/Licensee detectable and OSI-approved.

The `license` table contains this data.

## Collection Strategy

### Repositories

We are interested in finding every repository on GitHub that fits the following criteria:

- Is public
- Has a machine detectable OSI-approved license
- Is not a fork
- Is not a mirror
- Is not archived
- Was created on GitHub during `[1970-01-01, 2020-01-01)`

In order to perform such a query with the GitHub API we most first identify *search* queries which yield fewer than 1,000 results (the maximum number of results any query will return). The way we achieve the task is through searching for every public, non-fork, non-mirror, non-archived, public repository with `X` license where `X` is a machine-detectable OSI-approved license. In addition, the code will limit results based on when the repository was created (a persistent value) and shorten the interval until fewer than 1,000 results are returned.

We store the query parameters and perform the iterative process for each license of interest.

The `queries` table contains is used to store the queries and track their status.

For each query, we obtain each of the resulting repositories and their associated data.

The `repos` table contains this data and is used to track the status of the commit data for each repository.

### Commits

For each repository, we query the commit data based on the time coverage of the data collection.

The `commits` table contains this data and is used to update the status of the repository commit data at the `repos` table.

!!! note

    Commit users may show with a `NULL` login which indicates that the commit email does not match those associated with any GitHub account.

!!! note

    Commit timestamps sometimes may have have strange dates dating back before the creation of version control (usually the Epoch time). For those commits, we replace the value with the earliest commit date in that repository that seems valid.

## How To Use

In order to use this package, refer to the example in the [test suite](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/OSSGH.jl/blob/master/test/runtests.jl) and the [CI script](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/OSSGH.jl/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml). The prefered solution is through a containerized application such as the CI using Docker but any environment with the required components will do.

### Components

- Internet Access
- Julia v1 (current release v1.3.1)
- A PostgreSQL database connection (tested with v11 and v12)
